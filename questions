Questions to be ready to answer (donâ€™t have to implement):

1) Add weighted edges support in your lib. 
2) Add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph.
3) Make you graphs thread safe.

1) Add weighted edges support in your lib.
Add weighted field to adjacency lists, not only vertex

2) Add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph.
Create class to implement traverse function. Just use dfs to traverse every vertex and apply the user defined function

3) Make you graphs thread safe.
Use unmodifiable implementation of graph. return new graph on each mutable function
